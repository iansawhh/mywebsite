                <justify>Thank you for your interest in my services. I want all of my clients to know me
                    on a personal level. This is because I want it to be known that by contracting me
                    as opposed to a tech-firm, you will recieve a personal connection and guarantee of high 
                    quality service that I am willing to stake my career on. To begin, I am a student at 
                    the New Jersey institute of technology. My major is Computer Science (b.s. Computer Science) and my
                    interest is in computational mathematics. I am dedicated to the work that I do, not just
                    because it is my job, but because it is my life long passion. Ever since I was a child,I knew
                    I wanted to one day pursue a career in STEM. My dream was finally realized not too long ago,
                    and I have been striving for perfection since.</justify>
